Their flat shape enables them to readily hide in cracks and crevices. The body becomes more elongate, swollen, and dark red after a blood meal. Bed bugs have a beaklike piercing-sucking mouthpart system Bed bugs do not fly, but can move rapidly over floors, walls, ceilings and other surfaces Female bed bugs lay their eggs in secluded areas, depositing 1, 2 or more eggs per day and hundreds during a lifetime Nymphs can survive months without feeding and the adults for more than a year Bed bugs are active mainly at night. During the daytime, they prefer to hide close to where people sleep Their flattened bodies enable them to fit into tiny crevices \u2014 especially those associated with mattresses, box springs, bed frames and headboards Bed bugs usually attack humans, but may feed on other warm-blooded animals, including pets All people are not equally sensitive to bed bug bites, so while some victims break out in rashes from the bites, other people may not display symptoms.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading stripe_pos=&#8221;hide&#8221; text=&#8221;Bed Bugs Management &#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|font_size:20|text_align:left|line_height:1.25&#8243; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][vc_custom_heading stripe_pos=&#8221;hide&#8221; text=&#8221;Vacuuming&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|font_size:16|text_align:left|color:%23e31d22|line_height:1.25&#8243; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;1893&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1496477609196{margin-bottom: 5px !important;}&#8221;][vc_column_text]The use of a sealed vacuum during bed bug treatments is useful Models with strong suction and a directed nozzle can be used to help extract some bed bugs hiding in protected crevices and remove the eggs Vacuums can also be useful for picking up individuals when seen and a general vacuuming of floors and other surfaces may pick up bed bugs that have migrated or been dislodged during bed bug treatments Immediately after use, vacuum bags should be removed, sealed in plastic, and discarded to reduce chances of accidentally spreading bed bugs[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][vc_custom_heading stripe_pos=&#8221;hide&#8221; text=&#8221;Residual Spraying&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|font_size:16|text_align:left|color:%23e31d22|line_height:1.25&#8243; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;1897&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1496477648724{margin-bottom: 5px !important;}&#8221;][vc_column_text]Insecticides may be applied as liquids directly to cracks, crevices, bed frames, baseboards, or similar sites[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][vc_custom_heading stripe_pos=&#8221;hide&#8221; text=&#8221;ULV Misting&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|font_size:16|text_align:left|color:%23e31d22|line_height:1.25&#8243; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;1899&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1496477691591{margin-bottom: 5px !important;}&#8221;][vc_column_text]Use a space spray to penetrate an infested area Close all outside doors, windows, etc., as tightly as possible.
